- should feature a left file-browser sidebar pane that defaults to opening to the last selected XDF parent folder, it shows all the XDF files in that folder and allows the user to double click one to load it
- after selecting an XDF file, a progress spinner should be displayed in the main view to indicate that it's trying to load the file until it's ready
- after loading an XDF file, all streams should be selected by default
-
- the "Lab Streaming Layer stream initialized. Please start LabRecorder and ...." dialog after starting a stream should not be shown.
